# Computer Vision

This directory describes the work I've done about computer vision. 


## Description 

I did some minor projects about computer vision, but I only did one concrete project during a class at Polytechnique Montreal. 

The project was the implementation of a research paper about semantic segmentation using RGB-D.

The link to the project is the following :
