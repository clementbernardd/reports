# Reinforcement learning 

This directory describes the work I've done about reinforcement learning. 


## Description 

### 1. Semester project

I did a semester project at Eurecom, where I had to implement a recommendation system using reinforcement learning. 

The link to the repository is the following : 

https://github.com/clementbernardd/network_friendly.

The report is in the file `semester_project.pdf`.

### 2. Internship

Then, after the semester project, I did an internship of 2 months at Oscaro (https://www.oscaro.com/). 

As I didn't have a lot of time, I worked on the same subject of the previous semester project : implementing a recommendation system using reinforcement learning. 
The only difference is that I used Oscaro data instead. 

The report is in the file `internship_project`. 


### 3. Class project

I did a project at Polytechnique Montreal, where we had to implement a paper about deep learning.

I decided to implement a reinforcement learning paper. 

The code is available at : 

https://github.com/clementbernardd/Count-Based-Exploration. 

The final report is in the file `class_project.pdf`.
