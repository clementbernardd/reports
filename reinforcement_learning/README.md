# AWS 

This directory describes the work I've done related to the cloud computing class. 

The main goal of this class was to play and experiment with `aws`.

## Description

I worked on three different aspects around `aws`. 

### 1. Clusters creation and HTTP requests 

The first one was the creation of clusters, the sending of HTTP requests to two different clusters through an Elastic Load Balancer.

### 2. Hadoop vs Spark comparison 

The aim of this work was to compare Hadoop (in local) and Spark (in an Azure environment).

### 3. ECS vs EKS comparison 

This work was the final work I've done related to `aws`. It was a project where the aim was to compare the deployment solutions of containers. 

I implemented two containers deployment solutions using terraform. The aim was not to create new deployment solutions, but to use the existing ones and to compare the results.
