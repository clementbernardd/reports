# NLP 

This directory describes the main works I've done about NLP.

## Description 

### 1. Class project 

The first project I did was the implementation of a chatbox in a NLP class. We were three in the group, and I had to implement the question-answering part whereas my colleagues had to implement the document retriever part. 

We won the intern competition of the class on Kaggle. 

The report is in the file `class_project.pdf`. 

### 2. Internship 

I did an internship at BusterAI (https://buster.ai/), where I had to implement the results of a paper. 

The report is in the file `internship.pdf`.
