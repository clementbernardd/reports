# Reports

This repository is a summary of the previous projects I've been working on.

It includes the link to the project, and the final report (if it exists). 

It does not include the classes that I've done where we only had small projects or only laboratories. 

## Description

The directory is composed of the following projects : 

- `AWS` : Cloud computing class where we played with `aws`. 
- `hackathon` : The hackathons I've either participated or organized.
- `NLP` : The project and internship I've done related to NLP.
- `reinforcement_learning` : The project and internship I've done related to reinforcement learning.
